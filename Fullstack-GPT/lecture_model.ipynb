      "7. If you have a pasta machine, pass the dough through the machine, starting with the widest setting and gradually reducing the thickness until you reach the desired thickness for your pasta. If you don't have a pasta machine, you can use a rolling pin to roll out the dough as thin as possible.\n",
      "8. Once the dough is rolled out, you can cut it into your desired pasta shape. For example, you can cut it into thin strips for spaghetti or fettuccine, or into squares for ravioli.\n",
      "9. After cutting the pasta, you can cook it immediately in a large pot of salted boiling water for about 2-3 minutes, or until al dente. Alternatively, you can let the pasta dry for a few hours or overnight before cooking.\n",

      "\n",
      "Ingredients:\n",
      "- 1.5 kilograms of rice\n",
      "- 1 kilogram of nuruk (a Korean fermentation starter)\n",
      "- 10 liters of water\n",
      "- 400 grams of yeast\n",
      "- 400 grams of sugar\n",
      "\n",
      "Equipment:\n",
      "- Large pot or cauldron\n",
      "- Thermometer\n",
      "- Fermentation vessel (preferably made of glass or ceramic)\n",
      "- Cheesecloth or a clean cloth for covering the vessel\n",
      "- Airtight bottles for storing the finished soju\n",
      "\n",
      "Here are the steps to make Korean soju:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Rinse the rice thoroughly to remove any impurities. Soak the rice in water for about 2 hours, then drain.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Cook the rice in a large pot or cauldron with 10 liters of water. Bring it to a boil and then reduce the heat to low. Simmer the rice until it becomes soft and mushy, stirring occasionally to prevent sticking. This process usually takes about 1-2 hours.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Once the rice is cooked, remove it from the heat and let it cool down to around 40-45°C (104-113°F). This temperature is crucial for the fermentation process.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. Dissolve the nuruk in a small amount of warm water, then add it to the cooled rice. Mix well to ensure the nuruk is evenly distributed.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. In a separate container, dissolve the yeast and sugar in warm water. Let it sit for about 10 minutes until it becomes frothy.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. Add the yeast mixture to the rice and nuruk mixture. Stir well to combine all the ingredients.\n",
      "\n",
      "7. Transfer the mixture into a fermentation vessel, leaving some space at the top for the fermentation process. Cover the vessel with cheesecloth or a clean cloth to allow air circulation while preventing dust or insects from entering.\n",
      "\n",
      "8. Place the vessel in a warm and dark location, ideally around 25-30°C (77-86°F). Let it ferment for about 7-10 days. During this time, the mixture will undergo fermentation, converting the starches in the rice into alcohol.\n",
      "\n",
      "9. After the fermentation period, strain the mixture through a cheesecloth or fine mesh strainer to remove any solids. The liquid obtained is the soju.\n",
      "\n",
      "10. Transfer the soju into airtight bottles for storage. It is recommended to let the soju age for at least a month to develop its flavor before consuming.\n",
      "\n",
      "Note: The above process is a simplified version of making soju at home. Traditional soju production involves more complex steps and equipment. Additionally, please be aware of local laws and regulations regarding homemade alcohol production and consumption. \n",
